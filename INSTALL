Installation
============

Put the extracted folder in '~/.local/share/icons/' (create the last folder "icons" if it doesn't exist; here '~' is your home). Then, select Plataro in System Settings → Icons and click Apply.

If you update the set, don't forget to recreate the icon cache by choosing another icon set in System Settings → Icons, selecting Plataro again and clicking Apply.

**************
***  LXQt  ***

Put the extracted folder in '~/.local/share/icons/' and select it from Configuration Center → Appearance → Icons Theme.

Also, make sure that this box is checked: Appearance → Icons Theme → Colorize icons based on widget style (palette)
